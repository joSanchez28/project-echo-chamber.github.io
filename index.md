Has the high connectivity that came with the internet made us better? Is it fostering healthy discussion and debate between the different communities or is the amount of information available distracting us from the real issues of our society? Which sources are reliable? Who to trust? If we form an opinion, was it really our own or were we influenced by someone with an agenda? Do this things even happen or is this all just tin-foil hat speculation?
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Questions like this arise in our day-to-day interactions with modern social media but answering them requires having a good understanding of where the information is born, how it spreads and what factors and parameters influence its flow. To have a decent idea of how a particular technology (the internet no less) is shaping debate we need the tools and knowledge to leverage amounts of data unfathomable to a single human being.

This tools and knowledge are what comprise the fields of big data and data science. They exist, but still the amount of data grows relentlessly and outpaces our processing of it. And this is key, since it means there's always more insight to be had, putting us in a constant race for the hidden truth that's out there. Being a top contender in the race involves having the means and a reason to spend millions in analytics. And that's where I am headed with all of this: conflict of interest and ethics

In the past decade [more and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/02/18/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2018/#53d8e3342225) organisations have realised how important that hidden insight can be, including governments.  
[This article](https://www.businessinsider.com/campaign-big-data-use-politics-analytics-2017-6?r=US&IR=T) sums up the case of the 2016 US presidential election from the perspective of data analytics. Here's an interesting quote:

> He cited Abraham Lincoln's guide to campaigning.  
"It's like a list of 10 things," Sullivan said. "Basically, identify who is voting, ascertain as to who they will vote for, determine who's undecided, and persuade the undecideds. This s--- hasn't changed in the following 150 years."  
"Now, the tactics have changed," he continued. "And the tools. It has become somewhat more scientific."  
Chuck Todd's argument — that data has allowed campaigns to aim for maximum base turnout instead of working to persuade undecided voters — was echoed by others, even if they disagreed that it was the use of data itself that was contributing to increased polarization in the country.

So basically,

## Abstract
In this project we will adopt the perspective of a malicious agent that wants to meddle in the 2016 election via social engineering at large scale and try to demonstrate how the so called [echo chamber effect](https://tinyurl.com/pxpdddo), one of the main arguments presented against modern mass social media, could be exploited to find collectives on the net and target propaganda tailored to their views.  
We will use natural language processing techniques on massive public data available on Reddit to try and exploit the isolation that some communities experiment in order to classify it's users according to their political views. This would be the first step that a rogue agent would need to perform in order to fine-tune a massive propaganda campaign.

We believe that this is really important since big challenges lie ahead of our generation: climate change, the rise of populism or the increasing inequality, both between nations and within borders, just to give a few examples. Fake news and crafted narratives have been a hot topic for a while, and while the internet has given certain agents the ability to reach a lot of people with minimal effort it has also provided huge advancements just for the mere fact that sharing information and knowledge is easier than ever in history. Hence, understanding the way in which we communicate through that vast network is key in order to come up with ways to protect ourselves from bad actors that might try to influence our reasoning.
